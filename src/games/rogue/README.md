# Roguelike RPC

The objective of this really basic roguelike game is to be the last one alive with the highest quantity of treasures found.

For this, the client implementing the player's actions, should navigate an unknown dungeon interacting with doors, avoiding traps, picking up objects and possible facing enemies and other players.

Because there's always the possibility of nobody dying, there will be a time limit (specified number of turns) before the game ends. In this case, the player with the highest quantity of treasures will win.
